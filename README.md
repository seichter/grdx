# grdx
Minimal system for grading PC exams

## Purpose

grdx originated in a small tool to parse through some "student" id files in order to manage large PC exams. However, grading each submission is a usual chore for a lecturer.
To relieve myself from some repetition an bookkeeping duties I build a small UI on top of it.

## Requirements
